R code used to process output of SLiM and make figures.

# analysis_stab.R
Used to analyze results of simulations where all traits are under stabilizing selection. Produces graphs in Fig. 2 and Fig S1. 

# analysis_qn.R
Used to analyze results of simulations where a focal trait is under no selection, whereas other traits are under stabilizing selection. Produces graphs in Fig. 3 and Fig. S2

# analysis_dir.R
Used to analyze results of a focal trait is under directional selection, whereas other traits are under stabilizing selection (Wright-Fisher). Produces Fig. 4A and Fig. S4.

# analysis_dir_nwf.R
Used to analyze results of a focal trait is under directional selection, whereas other traits are under stabilizing selection (non-Wright-Fisher). Produces Fig. 4B, Fig. S5, and Fig. S6.

# frac_beneficial.R
Used to estimate the fraction of mutations that a beneficail when a focal trait is under directional selection, whereas other traits are under stabilizing selection.
