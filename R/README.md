This folder contains R codes used for simulations and analysis of simulation results.

function.R contains functions frequently used in other codes.

sim.R is for simulation of evolution in a two-dimensional phenotypic space (not used in the current version).

sim_zero_cor.R is for simulation of evolution in a two-dimensional phenotypic space with zero mutational covariance (not used in the current version).

sim_mv.R is for simulation of evolution in a multi-dimensional phenotypic space.

sim_mv_2.R is is for simulation of evolution in a multi-dimensional phenotypic space with the mutational architecture being modular.

sim_analysis.R is for analysis of simulation output and generating plots.
