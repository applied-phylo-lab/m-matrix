This folder contains R codes used for simulations and analysis of simulation results.

function.R contains functions frequently used in other codes.

sim.R is for simulation of evolution.

sim_zero_cor.R is for simulation of evolution when the mutational covariance is zero.

sim_mv.R is for simulation of evolution in a multi-dimensional phenotypic space.

sim_analysis.R is for analysis of simulation output and generating plots.
