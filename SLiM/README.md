This folder contains codes of SLiM simulations and output files.

# stabilizing/
Simulations where all traits under consideration are under stabilizing selection

# neutral/
Simulations where a focal trait is under no selection, whereas other traits are under stabilizing selection

# directional_WF/
Simulations where a focal trait is under directional selection, whereas other traits are under stabilizing selection

# directional_nWF/
Simulations where a focal trait is under directional selection, whereas other traits are under stabilizing selection. Non-Wright-Fisher populations are simulated.


In each directory, there are the following sub-directories:

# 2_traits/
Simulations with mutational architectures producing the same 2-dimensional M-matrix.

# 5_traits/
Simulations with mutational architectures producing the same 5-dimensional M-matrix.

# 10_traits/
Simulations with mutational architectures producing the same 10-dimensional M-matrix.
