This folder contains codes of SLiM simulations and output data files.

The 3 enclosed folders are for three types of scenarios respectively.
"./stab": all traits are under stabilizing selection
"./neutral": the focal trait is not under selection while other traits are under stabilizing selection.
"./directional": the focal trait is under directional selection while other traits are under stabilizing selection.

Naming rules for files are described below.

The following files are codes to simulate 2, 5, and 10 traits, respectively:
"2_traits.txt",
"5_traits.txt",
"10_traits.txt".

Files whose names contain "0pl", ... , "50pl" are output files of simulations with 0, ..., 50 pleiotropic loci, respectively.
