Below are descriptions for some data files specific to this directory.

# sum_stab.txt
A summary of simulation outcomes under different conditions. Used to generate figures. Columns: number of traits, number of pleiotropic loci, evolutionary variance (averaged across traits), genetic variance (averaged across populations and traits), standard error of evolutionary variance, standard error of genetic variance.

# rmat_<number_of_traits>t_<number_of_pleiotropic_loci>pl.txt
Evolutionary covariance matrices computed using mean phenotypes of replicate populations at the end of simulations.

# sum_rmat.txt
A summary of features of Evolutionary covariance matrices under different conditions. Columns: number of traits, number of pleiotropic loci, rank number of evolutionary covariance matrix, variance of eigenvalues of evolutionary covariance matrix, P-value for a test of difference between observed and expected eigenvalue variance.
