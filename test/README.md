function_sim.R contains the function used to simulate evolution, and code for testing the simulation function.

function_convert.R contains functions used to convert a set of mutational parameters to a different set that give rise to the same M matrix.

sim.R is used to simulate evolution.

sim_zero_cor.R is used to simulate evolution when there is zero mutational covariance.
